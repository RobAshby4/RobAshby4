# About Me 

All my life I have enjoyed tinkering with new things, from taking apart old broken machinery to learning how the tools I use daily function there has always been a curiosity that knaws at me until I understand it. This innate curiosity has pushed me to learn and expand my horizons, while keeping me engaged in tech old and new. I face every day with the hope that I learn something new!

# Current Projects

### Gogils

#### What is it? 

Gogils is a tool that helps with finding crafting data for the MMORPG FFXIV. Specifically, what it does that other tools don't is integrate pricing data to help you find the most cost effective (gil wise) way to prepare a crafting recipe, or if it is even profitable to begin with.

#### Motivation

Besides the fact that it would be useful for me as a player, I wanted an excuse to make something using the Go programming langauge, specifically with using as few third party libraries as possible. Currently, I would call that goal a success as only the stdlib and first party libraries are in use. Though, this may change at a later date if a GUI is implemented

### Typing Tutor

#### What is it? 

There are many websites out there that allow you to benchmark your typing speed and really get a hang of how fast you can type, however I have yet to find one that perfectly encapsulates what I am looking for in a tool to practice typing. Therefore, I decided to make one myself! After all, only you know what you want best. ;)

#### Motivation

A while ago I got a new keyboard that had orthagonal keys, and was completely split down the middle! in the process of getting used to the new layout, I really felt like there was no tool that was available that had what I felt like I needed in order to adjust to the new typing style. It also presented a good oppotunity to get famailiar with some new GUI libraries, specifically Raylib! And what better way to get used to a new keyboard than trial by fire (coding with a new layout).

### KLOW

#### What is it? 

Though rather rudimentary, KLOW is an n-gram predictive text langugage model. After training the model on various texts (including twitter archive data) you can then use a seed phrase that the model will try to complete in a statistically likely manner. The closest comparison would be the predictive text on your phone's keyboard. The reason that it is called KLOW however is that it is admittedly poorly optimized, and therefore Kinda sLOW.

#### Why make it?

There were two main goals behind KLOW. Firstly was to better understand some of the origins behind current LLM tech, such as tokenization, statistic modeling, and data parsing. The second was to practice some of my functional programming skills, since that is a muscle that you rarely get to flex in a world somewhat dominated by various other coding paradigms. Specifically, Clojure was used for this project, and while the performance of the model is somewhat subpar, it is more a reflection on how much I have left to learn with Clojure than any sort of reflection on the language itself.

### Wordle Solver (Defunct) 

#### What is it? 

Ever wanted to get a perfect wordle score without looking up the answer? Me too!! So I came up with a bot that opens up wordle in your browser, and plays the game for you! While there is a bit more going on behind the scenes to give the bot the best chance at getting the right word, there are sometimes just no guarantees with wordle. While this bot was originally working, updates to the site have broken the parsing, making it no longer able to play the game.  

#### Why make it?

Curious on how to interact with web pages through scripting, I decided that a bot that could play wordle would be proper exercise. Using selenium to spin up a browser and hook into the page, I was able to better learn and understand how to parse your way through some complicated html and properly interact with the page you are visiting without having to lift a finger!
